Experiment No. - 2

Aim of the Experiment : Study of List in Python

Theory : The following topics were covered during the Lecture : 
1) Introduction to "list" in python
2) To print Alphanumeric list
3) To implement Indexing of the list
4) To replace an element in list - (list5[2] = "Orange")
5) To add an element in the list - list6.append("mango")
6) To change the position of an element in list - list7.insert(1,"mango")
7) To combine two list - list8.extend(list9)
8) Practice Questions - [max(),min(),len(),sum(),sum()/len(),sort()]
9) Practice Questions - [append(),remove()]

Algorithm :
   1) Marks list of students calculation
      - Enter the Data (mark list)
      - Read the list
      - Perform : max() - maximum of the list ,min() - minimum of the list , len() - Number of stuents , sum() - Sum of marks of the students , sum()/len()-average of marks of the students , sort() - To sort the list in ascending order
      - Print the Result
   2) Grocery List
       - Enter the List
       - Read the List
       - Perform : append() - To add an item to the grocery list , remove() - To remove an item from the grocery list
       - Print the result

Conclusion : The study of List in Python was successfully completed
